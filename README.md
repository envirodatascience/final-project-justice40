* Project: Justice40 and Race: Demographics and Severity of Environmental Burden
* Participants: Allie Garrett and Cate York
* Goals of the project: To work with the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool data in order to better understand how the Justice40 initiative will meet its goal of ensuring federal investments in climate, clean energy, and housing flow to "communities that are marginzlied by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution," specifically examining whether the tool captures race implicitly. 
* Files in the repository: ENV617_Justice_40.ipynb is the Colab notebook with our final analysis; CEJST_variables_explained.xlsx contains a list of the variables organized by their burden categories and data sources. 
* Citations for data used: "Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool," Version 1.0, released November 2022 by the White House Council on Environmental Quality: https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/downloads.
